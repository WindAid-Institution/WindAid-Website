/* In the pages folder, there will be subfolders for each page of the application. Each subfolder will include 
an index.js file and all the necessary components needed to complete the page. 

Each component will have their own folder with TWO files (JS file and CSS file -- similar breakdown to 
the components folder).

All the components will be imported into their own index.js, which will then be imported into the 
main index.js file. 

The main index.js file will render everything to the DOM.
