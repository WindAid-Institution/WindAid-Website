      "Access to electricity is a basic necessity for the quality of life of any human being living today. Many of us don’t even think twice about turning on the light switch in our homes, but energy poverty severely limits the ability and opportunity for those without access to electricity to thrive. We want to change that.",

Due to the difficulties and costs associated with connecting to traditional power grids, 37% of people in these communities have never had electricity in their homes. It is these communities we strive to work with and ensure that they can enjoy the benefits of a life changing resource.",
