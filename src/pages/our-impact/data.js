    TITLE: "7 million Peruvians do not have access to electricity.",
    BODY:
      "Access to electricity is a basic necessity for the quality of life of any human being living today. Many of us donâ€™t even think twice about turning on the light switch in our homes, but energy poverty severely limits the ability and opportunity for those without access to electricity to thrive. We want to change that.",

    TITLE:
      "A large part of this population is located in rural areas that do not yet have the support of the Peruvian government.",
    BODY_ONE:
      "The people most in need of access to energy in Peru live in remote, rural locations. Due to the difficulties and costs associated with connecting to traditional power grids, 37% of people in these communities have never had electricity in their homes. It is these communities we strive to work with and ensure that they can enjoy the benefits of a life changing resource.",
    BODY_TWO:
      "A life without electricity is hard. If you were to imagine a list of your daily activities, it is likely most of them involve electricity in some way. A reliance on alternative energy sources for rural communities can be expensive, unreliable and unsafe. We want to change that.",

  ELECTRICITY: {
    HEADING: "Electricity means better health, safety and economic growth.",
    PARAGRAPH:
      "The impact a renewable source of energy can bring is breathtaking. Call phones can be charged to open up communication with other communities. The reliance on dangerous candles and fire for interior light is gone. Children can study at night when natural light is scarce. ",
